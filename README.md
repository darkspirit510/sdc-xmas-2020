# sdc-xmas-2020

Great news that you're interested in my x-nmas workshop! After this course you'll be able to do small setups with openHAB. My planned agenda is short:

- A general introduction into smart home and how openHAB *sees* the world (important wordings, basic definitions and ideas, do's and don'ts, limitations)
- Free work ðŸ•º (i'll prepare some tasks until christmas)
- Small lookout what can/could be done with openHAB

I'll try to setup some remote instances, but the prefered way is an own openHAB installation. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions or need assitance with your setup.

## Preperation

This step is only necessary if you wan't to run your own instance. openHAB offers several ways to be run. My recommendations are:

- If you have a spare Raspberry Pi, run [https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/openhabian.html](openHABian) on it
  - Pro: Basically just flashing an image and everything is there
  - Con: Might bring more than needed (like SMB access and some other things)
- Even simpler - just run openHAB with [https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/docker.html](Docker)
  - Pro: Just openHAB, nothing else. Fast and easy to maintain/update, also can be run with other software
  - Con: Requires Docker ðŸ˜…

Either way, during first access openHAB asks which UIs should be installed. Select "recommended" and wait (depending on your platform this might take some time). If you can access the PaperUI, that's it. Now you're ready for the workshop.
